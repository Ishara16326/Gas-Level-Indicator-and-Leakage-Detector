# Gas-Level-Indicator-and-Leakage-Detector

One of the problems we face in our daily lives is the inability to measure the amount of gas in the 
gas cylinder. To overcome those problems with some protection, this Gas level indicator is 
displayed the gas level as a percentage on the LCD display. Also, if a gas leakage happens around 
the gas tank, this leakage detector system detect the leakage. As soon as the leakage is detected, 
a buzzer will alarm the user about it.
